# News_Monkey

A React News App with Flask Backend 

The app gets its data from an API request to the backend which is based on Flask. Different requests for each category like Health, Sports, Entertainment, etc... 
The app gets refreshed for the latest News every 24 hours using the News API of newsapi.org. 
Developed the whole React-Router-Dom to seamlessly access different domains of news without reloading the page. 
The Flask API from the backend contains the actual NewsAPI key from newsapi.org, hence this Flask server acts as the perfect server to always give the latest news from all over the world(Mostly US).
