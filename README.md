# News_Monkey

A React News App with Flask Backend 

- The app involves react frontend and flask backend to provide latest news efficiently.
- The frontend gets its data from an API request to the backend which is based on Flask.
- Different requests for each category like Health, Sports, Entertainment, etc...
- The whole frontend has been made seemless using React-Router-Dom, which allows to see different domain of News without reloading the page.
- The Flask API from the backend contains the actual NewsAPI key from newsapi.org. 

This Flask server acts as the perfect solution to always give the latest news from all over the world(mostly US).
